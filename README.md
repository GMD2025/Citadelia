## Collaboration

After cloning this repository to the local environment the one must execute **`./git_scripts/install-hooks.sh`**.  
This has to be done to ensure:

- Unity VCS (plastic) includes only the files ignored by git. This ensures that game objects, scripts, etc are used by git and all the assets, packages, sprites, images are used by Unity VCS.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> **Windows** users must use git bash terminal or pre-installed WSL in order to successfully run the script
